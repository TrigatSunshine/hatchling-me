        <h2>other aspects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>we are a system, a group of parts working together. we do not find the concepts of 'plurality' or
                'median' helpful, but we are also not a singlet. think of us as a group of voices (<em>kulupu
                    kalama</em>), sorted by source, tied to the world through Hatch. a set of skills (<em>ilo ken</em>)
                to make the contradictions of life a bearable experience.</li>
            <br>
            <li>i call myself a <em>cyborg</em> because i am aware that there is no mediation between my body and my
                tools, they extend each other's boundaries and allow for an interaction with the bounds of other people
                (their physical and metaphisical "edges"). i am an organism and a mechanism, enhanced and limited by the
                technology that is my body, that works with my body.</li>
            <br>
            <li>my body is my point of contact with things beyond me; my being white, poor, bisexual, transmasculine,
                low vision and mentally ill shapes my interactions with other people and the world i live in. i can only
                hope that i can make these interactions as kind and just as i know how, as long as i am alive.</li>
