        <h2><em>kulupu kalama</em>, a set of voices</h2>
        <p>
            I am an avid fan of the RPG videogame Disco Elysium, which has a mechanic where the character you play
            divides his stats into four categories (Intellect, Psyche, Physique, Motorics) and each of those has 6
            Skills that give you information throughout the game through normal dialogue and passive-active difficulty
            checks. The character talks to them and they talk to each other, and make for an unique psychological
            experience that is very similar to the way my brain operates.
        </p>
        <p>
            What I call <em>facets</em> feel like side-cuts in a lens that shift perspectives and provide a new view of
            the same reality. They are not separate from me, and they don't really take over. We do more than share a
            body, we are bound by the same experiences and biases, but they act as possible interpretations of my inner
            and outer world, and I can feel them as distinct from my baseline stream of consciousness. They are all
            sides of me through which the world takes a different shape -- I am a prism.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have grouped them in categories inspired by the game, though they have always presented in a
            characteristic synesthetic manner. My trains of thoughts are a colorless, odorless pool and thoughts coming
            from the facets feel like
            drops of food colouring, bright and stark against such familiar background.
        </p>

        <h2>who are we?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hatch</strong> - I am usually the person in the driver's seat, the point of contact between my
                facets and the reality I live in and the person making the choice of whether I incorporate their input
                into my consciousness.</li>
            <li><strong>Intellect</strong> - We deal with the narratives of reality and fiction, the stories we tell
                ourselves and the categories of what is. </li>
            <li><strong>Psyche </strong> - We are the will and desire, the mirror room where we see Hatch in himself
                and others, and what could be.</li>
            <li><strong>Physique</strong> - We are Hatch's body and instincts, centuries of human history reading the
                base inputs of his anatomy.</li>
            <li><strong>Motorics</strong> - We are the understanding of how things work on a mechanical level, the
                parts that need to move for something to work, to turn out as expected.</li>
        </ul>
